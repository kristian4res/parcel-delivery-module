# parcel-delivery-module
A service for arranging parcel collection and deliveries.

It is composed of multiple services, but the main service is the API (```api```, see its `README.md` for details) which can be used independently from a ```client```.
Ideally the client for this API would be something that will be used by the employees or couriers.

**NB:** Currently this system supports the basic requirements and functionality required for a parcel delivery system. This is by no means a fully featured service that covers all aspects of a parcel delivery system.
